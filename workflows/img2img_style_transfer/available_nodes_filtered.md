### AegisFlow Utility Nodes

**Description:**

These nodes will be placed in comfyui/custom_nodes/aegisflow and contains the image passer (accepts an image as either wired or wirelessly, input and passes it through.

### ComfyUI Resynthesizer

**Description:**

This repository is a quick port of [a/Resynthesizer](https://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer) to ComfyUI.
Resynthesizer is the open-source implementation of a texture generation technique proposed by Paul Harrison in 2005, especially useful for removing an object from an image (inpainting), which is most likely close to what Photoshop uses to for the content aware fill feature. Note that this is not using a diffusion model to inpaint, as opposed to many techniques of today, which makes it very fast and predictable, but sometimes yields worse results.

### ComfyUI-AutomaticCFG

**Description:**

My own version 'from scratch' of a self-rescaling CFG. It isn't much but it's honest work.
TLDR: set your CFG at 8 to try it. No burned images and artifacts anymore. CFG is also a bit more sensitive because it's a proportion around 8. Low scale like 4 also gives really nice results since your CFG is not the CFG anymore. Also in general even with relatively low settings it seems to improve the quality.

### ComfyUI-Stereopsis

**Description:**

This initiative represents a solo venture dedicated to integrating a stereopsis effect within ComfyUI (Stable Diffusion). Presently, the project is focused on the refinement of node categorization within a unified framework, as it is in the early stages of development. However, it has achieved functionality in a fundamental capacity. By processing a video through the Side-by-Side (SBS) node and applying Frame Delay to one of the inputs, it facilitates the creation of a stereopsis effect. This effect is compatible with any Virtual Reality headset that supports SBS video playback, offering a practical application in immersive media experiences.

### ComfyUI-SVDResizer

**Description:**

SVDResizer is a helper for resizing the source image, according to the sizes enabled in Stable Video Diffusion. The rationale behind the possibility of changing the size of the image in steps between the ranges of 576 and 1024, is the use of the greatest common denominator of these two numbers which is 64. SVD is lenient with resizing that adheres to this rule, so the chance of coherent video that is not the standard size of 576X1024 is greater. It is advisable to keep the value 1024 constant and play with the second size to maintain the stability of the result.

### comfyui_face_parsing

**Description:**

This is a set of custom nodes for ComfyUI. The nodes utilize the [a/face parsing model](https://huggingface.co/jonathandinu/face-parsing) to provide detailed segmantation of face. To improve face segmantation accuracy, [a/yolov8 face model](https://huggingface.co/Bingsu/adetailer/) is used to first extract face from an image. There are also auxiliary nodes for image and mask processing. A guided filter is also provided for skin smoothing.

### ComfyUI_FaceShaper

**Description:**

Match two faces' shape before using other face swap nodes
Face-swapping tools typically only replace facial features during the swap, without altering the facial shape. When there is a significant difference in facial shape between the target person and the person in the original photo, the result of the face swap is less satisfactory.
This project is a small script that can first liquefy and stretch the face in the original photo according to the horizontal and vertical proportions of the target person's facial contour. The resulting image can be used as input for other face-swapping nodes.

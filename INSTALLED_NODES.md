## KJNODES/IMAGE

### Color Match (`ColorMatch`)


color-matcher enables color transfer across images which comes in handy for automatic  
color-grading of photographs, paintings and film sequences as well as light-field  
and stopmotion corrections.  

The methods behind the mappings are based on the approach from Reinhard et al.,  
the Monge-Kantorovich Linearization (MKL) as proposed by Pitie et al. and our analytical solution  
to a Multi-Variate Gaussian Distribution (MVGD) transfer in conjunction with classical histogram   
matching. As shown below our HM-MVGD-HM compound outperforms existing methods.

## KJNODES/MASKING/GENERATE

### Create Fade Mask Advanced (`CreateFadeMaskAdvanced`)


Create a batch of masks interpolated between given frames and values. 
Uses same syntax as Fizz' BatchValueSchedule.
First value is the frame index (not that this starts from 0, not 1) 
and the second value inside the brackets is the float value of the mask in range 0.0 - 1.0  

For example the default values:  
0:(0.0)  
7:(1.0)  
15:(0.0)  
  
Would create a mask batch fo 16 frames, starting from black, 
interpolating with the chosen curve to fully white at the 8th frame, 
and interpolating from that to fully black at the 16th frame.

## Graphical editor to create values for various   
## schedules and/or mask batches.  

**Shift + click** to add control point at end.
**Ctrl + click** to add control point (subdivide) between two points.  
**Right click on a point** to delete it.    
Note that you can't delete from start/end.  
  
Right click on canvas for context menu:  
These are purely visual options, doesn't affect the output:  
 - Toggle handles visibility
 - Display sample points: display the points to be returned.  

**points_to_sample** value sets the number of samples  
returned from the **drawn spline itself**, this is independent from the  
actual control points, so the interpolation type matters.  
sampling_method: 
 - time: samples along the time axis, used for schedules  
 - path: samples along the path itself, useful for coordinates  

output types:
 - mask batch  
        example compatible nodes: anything that takes masks  
 - list of floats
        example compatible nodes: IPAdapter weights  
 - pandas series
        example compatible nodes: anything that takes Fizz'  
        nodes Batch Value Schedule  
 - torch tensor  
        example compatible nodes: unknown

#### Outputs

- `MODEL`: `MODEL`
  - The modified diffusion model.
- `CLIP`: `CLIP`
  - The modified CLIP model.

### LoraLoaderModelOnly (`LoraLoaderModelOnly`)

LoRAs are used to modify diffusion and CLIP models, altering the way in which latents are denoised such as applying styles. Multiple LoRA nodes can be linked together.

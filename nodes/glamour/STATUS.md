# Glamour Node Status (`STATUS.md`)

## Current Status

*   **Implemented:**
    *   Basic ComfyUI Node structure (`glamour_node.py`).
    *   Core Python utility for image path management (`glamour_utils.py`).
    *   Backend API endpoints (`get_glamour_path`, `check_glamour_timestamp`) for JS communication.
    *   JavaScript logic (`js/glamour-*.js`) for fetching configurations, rendering image overlays, and basic state handling (loading images based on config).
    *   Initial support for different glamour states (`All Glamoured`, `Mixed`, `All Veiled`) via node widget.
    *   Transparency toggle widget.
*   **Partially Implemented / In Progress:**
    *   Handling interactions defined in `glamour.json` (basic structure exists, needs full implementation).
    *   Widget overlay rendering and mapping (needs implementation based on `glamour.json`).

## Known Limitations / Issues

*   Full interaction model (`on_click`, `on_hover`, etc.) from `glamour.json` spec is not yet implemented in JS.
*   Overlaying and interacting with standard ComfyUI widgets based on `glamour.json` is not yet implemented.
*   Error handling for missing configurations or assets could be improved.
*   Performance implications for large numbers of glamoured nodes haven't been tested.
*   No visual icon or card representation defined yet.

## TODOs / Future Work

*   [ ] Implement full `interactions` handling in `js/glamour.js`.
*   [ ] Implement widget overlay rendering and linking in `js/glamour-ui.js`.
*   [ ] Refine state management (default, cycling, setting states via interactions).
*   [ ] Add support for animated image formats (`.webp`, `.gif`) with `play_mode`.
*   [ ] Develop robust error handling and user feedback (e.g., placeholder visuals for missing assets).
*   [ ] Define and create default Icon and Card assets (`nodes/glamour/glamour/` folders).
*   [ ] Create standard `glamour.json` schema documentation/validation.
*   [ ] Investigate performance and optimization strategies.
*   [ ] Add caching mechanisms for fetched configurations/assets if needed.
*   [ ] Create basic tests (`glamour_test.py`).

## PRIORITY

**High.** This node is fundamental infrastructure for the visual and interactive aspects of other LOKI nodes.
